  <p>I'm Mahdi. I'm 25 years old. I'm a refugee. I'm basically from Afghanistan, but currently
    residing in Serpong, Tangerang, Indonesia. I have completed my secondary high school from
    a government school in Afghanistan and right now I'm self-studying Bahasa Indonesia and
    English. Besides, I have a certificate of English language from two different courses,
    one is from LEMBAGA BAHASA lIA and the other one is STAR COURSE BALIKPAPAN. Also i have
    studied some computer programming such as HTML, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript and
    I'm patient to improve my skills in this terms. I like reading books such as none faction
    books, self improvement books. As far as my skills and strength are concerned I'm a good
    reader, speaker, listener, thinker and communicator. Also I'm a hard working individual
    who Would like to do things with perfection. If I would talk about my nature then I would
    say that I'm an honest and straight forward man who would not compromise with any
    dishonesty in life or in work. I'm also polite and introvert person, which is why
    I have a few friends but good ones. I live a simple life keeping God as my priority
    in all aspects of my life, because I believe that without God the life is empty,
    meaningless, worthless, ruthless and hopeless. Therefore, it is must to know God and
    keep a healthy relationship with Him in order to live a blessed, peaceful, and joyful
    life. </p>
